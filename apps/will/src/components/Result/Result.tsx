            There are three vaccines against monkeypox. Although supplies are
            currently limited, get vaccinated if it is offered to you as they
            provide a valuable level of protection against the disease. After
            you have been vaccinated, continue to take care to avoid catching
            and spreading monkeypox; this is because it takes several weeks to
            develop immunity after being vaccinated, and because we donâ€™t yet
            know to what extent the vaccines protect you and if they stop you
            from infecting others as efficacy data in this outbreak setting is
            needed. Some countries are recommending vaccination for persons at
            risk. Many years of research have led to development of newer and
            safer vaccines for an eradicated disease called smallpox, which may
            also be useful for monkeypox. Two of these (MVA-BN and LC16) have
            been approved for prevention of monkeypox. Only people who are at
            risk (for example someone who has been a close contact of someone
            who has monkeypox) should be considered for vaccination. Mass
            vaccination is not recommended at this time.
